# Prototype validation

Validated on Windows x64 with Node.js 22.19.0, npm 10.9.3, PostgreSQL 18 (embedded), Next.js 16.4.5 and NestJS 11. The upstream repository recommends Node 22.23.x; use that newer Node 22 release when setting up a new machine.

## Automated checks

- Backend unit suite: 7 tests passed, including 6 travel policy tests.
- Real HTTP workflow suite: 47 checks passed against the actual NestJS API and PostgreSQL database. Covers authentication, agency/customer/region isolation, payload validation, linking, missing references, private notes, supplier-specific access, supplier-thread closure/reopening, status transitions, least-load/availability routing and idempotent escalation.
- Next.js optimized build and TypeScript checks passed; NestJS compilation passed.
- Staged frontend/backend ESLint checks passed via `npx lint-staged`; fixes were applied before publishing. The bundled Git shell lacked Bash for the Husky wrapper, so equivalent checks were run directly and the wrapper was skipped for the local commit only.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reported 0 known production dependency vulnerabilities at validation time. Development-tool advisories remain; no force-upgrade across major tooling versions was applied.

## Browser checks

- Signed in through the HTTP-only-cookie proxy.
- Created a new refund case for BK-1042 using the browser form. Verified two related cases, automatic agent selection and saved booking context.
- Opened a separate supplier conversation from that case. Verified it changed the ticket to Waiting supplier and appeared as its own thread.
- Opened Insights and verified the new case was reflected in case totals, issue categories and supplier counts.
- Inspected desktop and 390px mobile layouts; charts and controls reflow and wide tables retain horizontal scrolling.
- Restarted the database/application from the final output folder; existing records were preserved rather than reseeded. The interactive browser example adds one case to the initial 60-case dataset.

## Workflow acceptance map

The workflow follow-up passed 7 unit tests and 52 HTTP checks on Windows with Node.js 22.23.4 and an isolated PostgreSQL 18 database. The new migration applied on a fresh database. NestJS compilation, the optimized Next.js build and the production dependency audit passed. The initial preview timed out waiting for PostgreSQL, so validation started the database separately.

| Workflow area | Scenario to verify | Remaining scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connected history | Submit another complaint for BK-1042 and confirm earlier cases appear as separate records. Submit an unmatched reference and confirm the complaint and review event are saved without a booking link. | Live booking synchronization and fuzzy matching remain separate work. |
| Assignment | File an Asia case with the regional agent unavailable and check that eligible global coverage is used. When no eligible agent is available, the ticket stays unassigned. | Routing uses region, availability and workload. Category-based teams, shifts and capacity are pending. |
| Supplier conversations | Open an Aster thread, verify a Skyline account cannot reply, then reply as Aster and confirm the main ticket returns to support. Verify the customer cannot read the thread or private resolution reason. | The prototype uses in-app replies. |
| Travel deadlines | Verify the case deadline uses check-in for applicable service issues and a separate response target for refunds. | Dedicated departure and cancellation cutoffs and automatic recalculation on booking changes are pending. |
| Escalation | Advance the demo clock, inspect the manager queue, and repeat the sweep to verify a single event per rule and deadline. | External alerts and a separately deployed worker are pending. |
| Insights | Reconcile backlog, median response and resolution times, repeat contacts and breaches with the authorized saved cases and messages. | Reports aggregate the demo workspace. Scalable server-side analytics and performance targets are pending. |

## Boundaries

GitHub validation: the initial hosted Windows run could not start embedded PostgreSQL and did not reach application tests. CI now uses Linux with an isolated PostgreSQL 18 service and `--external-db`. Hosted Windows embedded-package compatibility remains unverified. Check the actual [implementation PR](https://github.com/DhruvKhanna7777/opsdesk-travel-support/pull/1/checks) and [handoff PR](https://github.com/DhruvKhanna7777/opsdesk-travel-support/pull/10/checks) results. Local Windows builds, lint, unit/API tests and production dependency audit passed separately.

This is a localhost prototype, not a production release. External LLM summaries, live email delivery, attachments and live supplier/booking-system integration were not exercised or presented as connected. All operational demo data is synthetic. The Bitext sample supplies complaint wording only.

The test script is for an isolated seeded demo. It creates and removes only its temporary cases, and restores the clock and agent availability used by the test scenario. It does not delete the interactive browser example.
